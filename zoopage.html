    <h3>Bears</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Bears/Ollie.html">Ollie</a></li>
      <p>
        He likes bear hugs even if you don't! His nickname is 'Rune Bear' iykyk
      </p>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Bears/Mona.html">Mona</a></li>
      <p>
        She will literally maul you if you call her Mona Lisa. Yes, she can
        understand you.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Giraffes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="./externalAnimalsource/Giraffes/Frankie.html">Frankie</a>
      </li>
      <p>
        He's short enough to be mistaken for a horse, but is still considered a
        giraffe.
      </p>
      <li>
        <a href="./externalAnimalsource/Giraffes/Coconut.html">Coconut</a>
      </li>
      <p>
        We named her Coconut because she purposefully dropped coconuts on the
        head of our previous zookeeper. We're not sure where she gets them from.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Lions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Lions/Mella.html">Mella</a></li>
      <p>Absolutely spoiled. Practically demands to be fed first.</p>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Lions/Karl.html">Karl</a></li>
      <p>
        Absolutely smart. While Mella throws a fit to be fed, he steals some of
        her food and still gets his portion.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Monkeys</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Monkeys/Cookie.html">Cookie</a></li>

      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Monkeys/Earl.html">Earl</a></li>
      <p>
        Has a stash of cookies and pudding cups that he keeps secret from the
        other two.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Alligators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Alligators/Wren.html">Wren</a></li>
      <p>
        Makes friends with the local birds. He even had a nest on his head at
        one point.
      </p>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Alligators/Aspen.html">Aspen</a></li>
      <p>
        Makes friends with the local turtles. He's been seen relaxing with his
        little entourage by the edge pond.
      </p>
      <li><a href="./externalAnimalsource/Alligators/Mika.html">Mika</a></li>
      <p>
        Full of energy. Quickly swims laps around the exhibit for no apparent
        reason and without warning. Scared our last zookeeper half to death.
